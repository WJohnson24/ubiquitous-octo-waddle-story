xTeam 8 Story:

The one thought that Jacob couldn't shake was that of all things Hollywood got wrong, this isn't what he could ever have expected. Shaking hands pawed at freshly torn jeans in a futile attempt at wiping away the mixture of blood and sweat that coated them. The slick mixture made maintaining a firm grip on the firemans axe impossible, spurring him to curse while a voice called out beyond the barricaded bathroom door, "Jake, let me in! I think they're starting to come up the stairwell!" 
Jacob had not been the most avid movie buff. He watched major films that came out in theaters every now and again, and participated in the occasional movie night. He'd seen a few zombie flicks, but they missed a cruicial detail- when the dead began to walk, they never lost the ability to talk. He tried his best to ignore the thing that was once his brother. 
Only now was he beginning to feel the pain in his leg. Did one of those crawlers snag him? It was hard to tell; it all happened so fast. One thing's for sure - people with zombie bites don't normally make it out alive in the movies. No time to think about that, though; he could hear them getting closer. 
Jacob opened the window as the noises approached him and stared into the darkness of the valley ahead. What appeared to be darkness was the silhouette of thousands of creatures approaching him.
He knew he was done. There was no surviving this now- either he would die being torn apart by that horde, or to the poison seeping up his leg. If he had to go out, he was going to go out fighting.
As the fire he set started to catch the rubbing alcohol poured over the bathroom walls, Jacob took a deep breath, then opened the door. "Hello brother."
